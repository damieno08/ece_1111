name:
    p01.exe

synopsis:
    p01.exe [options] matrix_file(s)

descr:
    Performs basic linear algebra operations on matrices.
    Supported operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    and determinant. Input matrices are read from text files.

options:
    -o, --operation   specifies the operation to perform
    -u, --usage       displays a one-line usage message
    -h, --help        displays this detailed help message

arguments:
    matrix_file(s): one or more text files containing matrix data.
                    For operations requiring two matrices, provide both
                    filenames (e.g., m1.txt m2.txt).
                    For determinant, provide a single matrix file.

examples:
    p01.exe --operation addition m1.txt m2.txt
    p01.exe -o subtraction m1.txt m2.txt
    p01.exe -o multiplication m1.txt m2.txt
    p01.exe -o determinant m1.txt
    p01.exe --usage
    p01.exe --help

notes:
    - Matrices must be formatted in plain text.
    - Ensure that matrix dimensions are compatible for the chosen operation.
    - Example: for addition and subtraction, both matrices must have the same
      number of rows and columns. For multiplication, the number of columns
      in the first matrix must match the number of rows in the second.
